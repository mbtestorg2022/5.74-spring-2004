Breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation in Diatomic Molecules
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Lectures by Professor Robert Field

This lecture series was offered during January 2005 as a follow-up to topics covered in 5.74.  Attendance was voluntary and open to any students with a background in quantum mechanics (5.61 or equivalent) and an interest in molecular dynamics.

[Lecture 3: Semiclassical Methods for Calculating Vibrational Overlap Integrals]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lecture-3)

_Description_

All coupling processes are mediated by vibrational overlap integrals, which are computed numerically. Semiclassical calculation of overlaps reveals physical factors controlling computed values: the length of the stationary phase region is controlled by the slopes of the potential curves at the intersection and the velocity in the crossing region.
